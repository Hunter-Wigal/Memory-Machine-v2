# MemoryMachineApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.7.

This application was created with the idea of storing information that could be hard to keep track of or needed better organized. Currently(11/12/2024)  it has the ability for users to login and store tasks and projects, where the projects can have relevant tasks assigned to them. There is also a calendar and schedule page that are both a work in progress that will allow viewing events on a calendar and setting a weekly schedule.

I actually started working on this app a few years ago when I needed a way to better organize my homework assignments for school. THe original app was created with Flask, and then converted to Angular 15.0.5, and now to Angular 17.3.7. This recent version is still slowly getting the features of the previous and hopefully expand even further on the original idea.
